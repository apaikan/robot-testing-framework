    `RobotTestingFramework`. The names of the target are unchanged.
    (e.g. `target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE RobotTestingFramework::RTF)`

    (e.g. `ROBOTTESTINGFRAMEWORK_ASSERT_ERROR("This is an error")`)
  * The module name for script languages was changed from `RTF` to
    `robottestingframework` or `RobotTestingFramework` (language dependent)
    (e.g. `robottestingframework.setName("PythonTestCase")`, and
    `RobotTestingFramework::setName("RubyTestCase")`)
* The `PREPARE_FIXTURE_PLUGIN` macro was renamed
  `ROBOTTESTINGFRAMEWORK_PREPARE_FIXTURE_PLUGIN`
* The `PREPARE_PLUGIN` macro was renamed `ROBOTTESTINGFRAMEWORK_PREPARE_PLUGIN`
