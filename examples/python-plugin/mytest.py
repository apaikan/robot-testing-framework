 RTF module is automatically imported by the python plugin loader
 to invoke the corresponding test case methods. To develop a new 
 test case simply implement the following class; (setup and tearDown 
 methods are optional) :

 class TestCase:
     def setup(self, param):
         return True

     def run(self):

     def tearDown(self):


 The following methods are for reporting, failure or assertions: 

 RTF.setName(name)             : sets the test name (defualt is the test filename)
 RTF.testReport(msg)           : reports a informative message
 RTF.testCheck(condition, msg) : reports the test message and marks the test as failed if condition is false
 RTF.assertError(msg)          : throws an error exception with message
 RTF.asserFail(msg)            : throws a failure exception with message
'''

class TestCase:
    # setup is called before the test's run to setup 
    # the user defined fixture
    # @return Boolean (True/False uppon success or failure)
    def setup(self, param):
        RTF.testReport("Preparing setup...")
        return True
   
    # The implementation of the test goes here
    def run(self):
        RTF.testCheck(5>3, "5 is bigger than 3.")
        RTF.testCheck(5<3, "5 is smaller than 3.")

    # tearDown is called after the test's run to tear down
    # the user defined fixture
    def tearDown(self):
        RTF.testReport("Tearing down...")
